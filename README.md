# Crypto AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Scanner

## Overview

The **Crypto AML Scanner** is a Python tool that helps analyze Ethereum wallet addresses for signs of high-risk or suspicious activity. It checks for interactions with flagged addresses, identifies high-volume transactions, and flags potential high-risk behaviors for further investigation.

### Features

- **Transaction Analysis**: Analyzes an address’s transaction history for high-value transfers.
- **AML Database Integration**: Checks if an address has interacted with known high-risk or flagged addresses.
- **Risk Assessment**: Provides a basic assessment of the risk level based on transaction volume and flagged interactions.

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you’ll need:

1. Python 3.x
2. Required libraries: `requests`, `json`, `logging` (standard libraries)

Install `requests` if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install requests
```

3. An [Etherscan API key](https://etherscan.io/apis) for accessing Ethereum transaction data.
4. A JSON file for the AML database, containing known flagged addresses (for example, `aml_database.json`).

### Usage

#### Step 1: Set Up Etherscan API Key and AML Database

- **api_key**: Replace with your Etherscan API key.
- **aml_database_path**: Replace with the path to your AML database JSON file, containing an array of flagged addresses under `"flagged_addresses"`.

Example `aml_database.json` format:
```json
{
    "flagged_addresses": [
        "0xExampleFlaggedAddress1",
        "0xExampleFlaggedAddress2"
    ]
}
```

#### Step 2: Run the Script

Replace `address` with the Ethereum address you want to analyze, then run the script:

```bash
py crypto_aml_scanner.py
```

The script will analyze the specified address and print a summary of any high-risk activity or associations.

### Example

If your AML database includes flagged addresses and you are checking the transaction history of an address `0xYourEthereumAddress`, the script will output a JSON summary of findings, including:

- **High Volume Transactions**: List of transaction hashes with values exceeding a set threshold.
- **Flagged Counterparties**: Addresses in the transaction history that are in the flagged AML database.
- **Risk Assessment**: Whether the address is potentially high-risk.

### Important Notes

- **AML Database**: This example uses a simulated database of flagged addresses. For production use, consider integrating with real AML data providers.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust volume thresholds or high-risk criteria as needed based on compliance requirements.

### Limitations

- **Blockchain-Specific**: This script is designed for Ethereum. To scan other chains, consider alternative APIs and adjust the code accordingly.
- **No Real-Time Monitoring**: This script performs a one-time scan. To monitor addresses continuously, use a scheduling tool like `cron` or integrate with a real-time blockchain service.

### Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Extend support to multiple blockchains by integrating APIs for networks like BSC or Polygon.
- **Enhanced AML Database Integration**: Add integration with a real-time AML database for comprehensive and updated lists of flagged addresses.
- **Automated Alerts**: Implement automated email or SMS notifications for addresses that trigger high-risk flags.
